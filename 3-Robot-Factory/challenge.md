# 3. Robot Factory on Kalliopea Prime

The resources mined on Columbus II are required to build robots on Kalliopea Prime. For each robot, 50 units of _material_ are required.

Implement a solution so that the robot factory can be notified when enough _material_ has been mined to build a robot. You might need to refactor your previous solutions to make room for this use case.
