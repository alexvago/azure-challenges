# 2. Accounting for resources

The accounting for the mining plant is handled on Endorra IV. The accountants would like to have access to a web application dashboard displaying how many resources have been mined so far. They are very picky about the availability of the app, so they want it to be highly available.

Implement and deploy a webapp with Azure App Service with access to the data stored by Miners. make sure to set up proper instance replication and health checks.

Bonus points if you set up some form of authentication.
